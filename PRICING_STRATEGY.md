- **100-125 images:** $8-14
- **150+ images:** $12-20
- **Mega bundles (300+):** $20-35

## Our Updated Pricing (Competitive)

### Bundle Prices:
| Bundle | Images | Price | Per Image | Position |
|--------|--------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Nature & Flowers | 100+ | **$12** | $0.12 | Mid-market |
| Cute Animals | 120+ | **$14** | $0.12 | Mid-market |
| Holiday Magic | 150+ | **$17** | $0.11 | Competitive |

**Strategy:** Mid-market pricing with quality positioning

---

## Price Comparison

### Old Pricing (Too High):
- Holiday Magic: ~~$29~~ → $17 (41% reduction)
- Nature & Flowers: ~~$24~~ → $12 (50% reduction)
- Cute Animals: ~~$27~~ → $14 (48% reduction)

**Why we were too expensive:**
- Etsy top sellers rarely exceed $20 for 150+ images
- Our $24-29 pricing was premium territory without brand recognition
- New brands need competitive pricing to gain traction

---

## Pricing Psychology

### $12-17 Sweet Spot:
1. **Impulse Buy Territory**
   - Under $20 = less consideration needed
   - Easy credit card purchase
   - "Why not?" vs "Let me think about it"

2. **Perceived Value**
   - $12 for 100 images = "great deal"
   - $17 for 150 images = "even better deal"
   - Not so cheap it seems low quality

3. **Competitive Positioning**
   - Not the cheapest (= quality)
   - Not the most expensive (= accessible)
   - Right in the sweet spot
