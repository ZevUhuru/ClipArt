# 🚀 Launch Roadmap - Clip.Art

## Current Status: Pre-Launch Email Collection ✅

You're now collecting emails without sending them (smart move!). Here's your path to launch.

---

## Phase 1: Build Product (Current - Next 2-4 Weeks)

### Week 1-2: Create Free Starter Pack
- [ ] Generate 10-15 high-quality images
- [ ] Pick a theme (Christmas coming up = good timing!)
- [ ] Create ZIP file with images
- [ ] Host on your server or use Gumroad/Dropbox
- [ ] Write simple README with licensing info

**Example themes:**
- Christmas clip art (timely!)
- General holiday pack
- Business/productivity icons
- Nature & flowers sampler

### Week 2-3: Create First Paid Bundle
- [ ] Pick your best-performing theme from analytics
- [ ] Generate 100-120 high-quality images
- [ ] Organize into folders by sub-category
- [ ] Create bundle cover image
- [ ] Write description and use cases
- [ ] Price: $12-14

### Week 3-4: Create Second Bundle (Optional)
- [ ] Different theme from first bundle
- [ ] 100-150 images
- [ ] Price: $12-17

**Target:** Have at least 1 paid bundle + 1 free pack ready

---

## Phase 2: Pre-Launch Prep (1 Week Before Launch)

### Set Up Payment Processing
**Choose one:**
- **Gumroad** (Easiest): Upload bundles, set prices, done
- **Lemon Squeezy**: Modern, good for digital products
- **Stripe + Your site**: Most control, more setup

**Recommended:** Start with Gumroad - easiest to test demand

### Set Up Email Service
- [ ] Create Resend.com account (free tier)
- [ ] Verify your domain
- [ ] Create email template
- [ ] Test sending to yourself

### Prepare Launch Email
**Subject lines to test:**
- "Your free clip art pack is here! 🎨"
- "Premium bundles are live (early bird 30% off)"
- "You're getting first access to Clip.Art"

**Email structure:**
1. Thank them for joining waitlist
2. Deliver free starter pack (download link)
3. Announce paid bundles
4. Early bird discount (30% off - 48 hours only)
5. Direct links to purchase
6. Clear CTA button

---

## Phase 3: Launch Day! 🎉

### Morning of Launch:
1. **Final checks:**
   - [ ] Free pack downloads correctly
   - [ ] Payment links work
   - [ ] Bundle descriptions look good
   - [ ] Prices are correct

2. **Export your email list:**
   ```bash
   # Visit admin dashboard
   http://localhost:3000/admin/waitlist
   
   # Click "Export CSV"
   # Upload to Resend
   ```

3. **Send launch email:**
   - [ ] Import emails to Resend
   - [ ] Send to entire list
   - [ ] Include: Free pack + early bird discount
   - [ ] Track opens and clicks

4. **Announce on social:**
   - [ ] Twitter/X
   - [ ] LinkedIn
   - [ ] Any communities you're in

### Track These Metrics:
- Email open rate (aim for 20-30%)
- Click-through rate (aim for 5-10%)
- Conversion rate (emails → sales)
- Revenue per email

---

## Phase 4: Post-Launch (First Week)

### Days 1-2: Early Bird Period
- Monitor sales
- Respond to questions quickly
- Share testimonials/screenshots

### Days 3-7: Regular Pricing
- End early bird discount
- Return to regular prices
- Send reminder email to non-openers

### Week 1 Review:
**Analyze what worked:**
- Which bundle sold better?
- What was conversion rate?
- Any feedback/complaints?
- What would you improve?
